SERVER API

    import server

    Many of the mud's raw data structures are available in the 'server' module.
    These were wrapped automatically using SWIG.

    Many of the global variables are available inside  server.cvar.

    Ex:
        server.cvar.character_list        Is a reference to the character_list
                                          variable in the mud.

    The data structures in server.cvar.* are the RAW ones, i.e.

    server.cvar.character_list  is a server.char_data, not a mud.Character

    The major thing that is absent in this interface are:

         - Macros, SWIG can't do this

         - Any function that uses printf-style arguments.  SWIG can't
           wrap C's vararg functions.

    A few of these capabilities are implemented in the mud.* API

MUD API

    import mud

    This API is implemented in python_script.c

    It provides some functions for controlling the python system, which are
    used mostly in   init.py  and modules.py

    It also provides a small set of objects that represent characters, objects,
    and rooms (So far)

    The interface is incomplete;

    However, these are the objects that will generally be passed from the mud server
    to the scripts.

    And they provide utilities not otherwise available, such as can_see.

    The major exception is the null events, but this will probably change before
    more events are implemented.
