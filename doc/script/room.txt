THIS IS API information for the bottled object class

 mud.Room

See API.txt for more info.

Note: Python code should not ever instantiate mud.Room objects directly.

Use
    server.py_Bottle_Room(vnum)

To convert a RAW server.room_data to a new bottled room.

There is no method provided to directly retrieve the raw structure from
the bottled one.

Provided Methods with example usages:

NONE YET

ATTRIBUTES (Mostly Read-ONLY)

  vnum
  name 
  people <- Returns a Python list of mud.Character elements, Or it returns None
            if noone is in the room

  contents <- Returns a python list of mud.Object elements, Or None if there
            aren't any in the room.

  zone_num <- Returns the zone vnum, or -1 if there was an error

  sector
  description
  flags
  light
  dirs <- Returns a python list of mud.Rooms in the various directions.  
          For directions that have no exit, the corresponding element
          will be Py_None

          so  
               If x.dirs[server.NORTH] == None       there's no exit

          otherwise, there  is an exit, and x.dirs[server.NORTH] is a reference
          to the room object.

exits <- This returns a dictionary with an element for each existing exit.
         And the value is a mud.Exit object.

         i.e.   If there's a north exit, then fooroom.exits["north"]
                points to the exit information held in the mud.Exit object
